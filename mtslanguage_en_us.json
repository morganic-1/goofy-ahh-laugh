This model is marketed under the name Skyhawk SP, although the Type Certification data sheet specifies it is a 172S.The 172S is built primarily for the private owner-operator and is, in its later years, offered with the Garmin G1000 avionics package and leather seats as standard equipment."

        "description": "While the BT-30 remains a good vehicle, there was severe limitations realized after the second great homeland war. The extensive mass deployment of chemical weapons in particular was something it could not handle, and it struggled with crossing uneven no-mans-land terrains so common on the southeastern front. This lead to the development of the BT-60. Prototypes for the BT-60 were in fact drawn up during the war, but the vehicle we know today, with the full NBC protetction, amphibious design and 8 axles did not roll off an assembly line before 1952."
